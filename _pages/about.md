Greetings! I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to you on my website. I am Mirza Farhan Bin Tarek, a dedicated and passionate individual pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Delaware working under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.udel.edu/rbi/'>Professor Beheshti</a> within the <a href='https://sites.udel.edu/healthylaife/'> healthy lAife lab </a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, healthcare, and fairness. My current research is on harnessing large language models (LLMs) to generate fair and unbiased clinical data, e.g., clinical vignettes and notes. 

Before my Ph.D., I completed my Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering from United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, and then joined the prestigious Brac University as a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering where I taught for more than 3 years. The experience helped me tremendously to secure the position of summer instructor for the CISC181 course in the Summer 2023 and Summer 2024 semesters at UD.

I thrive on challenges and am motivated to expand my knowledge and skill set continuously. My enthusiasm for learning knows no bounds, and I wholeheartedly embrace opportunities to explore new frontiers in the exciting domain of computer science.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I invite you to explore my work and achievements further.
